Welcome to kvm-unit-tests

See http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/KVM-unit-tests for a high-level
description of this project, as well as running tests and adding
tests HOWTOs.

This directory contains sources for a kvm test suite.

To create the test images do
  ./configure
  make
in this directory. Test images are created in ./<ARCH>/*.flat

Then use the runner script to detect the correct invocation and
invoke the test, e.g.
  ./x86-run ./x86/msr.flat
or
  ./run_tests.sh
to run them all.

To select a specific qemu binary, specify the QEMU=<path>
environment variable, e.g.
  QEMU=/tmp/qemu/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 ./x86-run ./x86/msr.flat

To create and use standalone tests do
  ./configure
  make standalone
  (send tests/some-test somewhere)
  (go to somewhere)
  ./some-test

'make install' will install all tests in PREFIX/share/kvm-unit-tests/tests,
each as a standalone test.

Directory structure:
.:		configure script, top-level Makefile, and run_tests.sh
./config:	collection of architecture dependent makefiles
./docs:		documentation files
./lib:		general architecture neutral services for the tests
./lib/<ARCH>:	architecture dependent services for the tests
./<ARCH>:	the sources of the tests and the created objects/images

See <ARCH>/README for architecture specific documentation.

Style
-----

Currently there is a mix of indentation styles so any changes to
existing files should be consistent with the existing style. For new
files:

  - C: please use standard linux-with-tabs
  - Shell: use TABs for indentation
